1.2.1
=====
Bugfixes:
    Fixed issue with NcML + SNAPSHOT NetCDF libs
    Handle single-item collection in CoverageJSON as a coverage, not a collection
    Fixed trailing slash issue on URI in CoverageJSON

1.2.0
=====
Moved configuration to web.xml where it can be overridden so that it persists across deployments
Moved User Guide into source tree, and setup gitbooks.com to automatically generate it on push.
Added examples module for example code using EDAL
Moved PlottingDomainParameters to the graphics module
Implemented CoverageJSON as output format for WMS GetMap (disabled by default)
Bugfixes:
    WMS deals with out-of-range TIME/ELEVATION values properly (i.e. with an XML ServiceException)
    Moved to (specific) SNAPSHOT version of NetCDF Java libs - the old ones were only in the repo by mistake

1.1.2
=====
Updated licence conditions to require use of ReSC logo in Godiva3
Bugfixes:
    Remove data from cache when (if) it refreshes periodically - this was causing no data update
    Correct handling of NaN in EN3/4 datasets
    Fixed NullPointerException when dataset title is missing from admin interface
    Godiva3 works properly on HTTPS
    Made http://server/ncWMS2/admin redirect to http://server/ncWMS2/admin/
    Fixed redirect issue on config update with Tomcat 8+
    Fixed TRANSPARENT/BGCOLOR clash - TRANSPARENT always implies BGCOLOR=transparent

1.1.1
=====
Changed default palette back to blues
Added face-based grids for UGRID conventions
Added workaround for 2D depth axes in UGRID
Optimised UGRID data reading - was previously not fast enough to work with OPeNDAP reliably
Bugfixes:
    Fixed KDTree range search (didn't account for longitude wrapping)
    Removed duplicate copyright messages from CSV download
    

1.1.0
=====
Support for unstructured grids which follow the UGRID conventions - includes refactor of dataset hierarchy
Support for categorical datasets, including plotting, legend, and GetFeatureInfo
Added more perceptually linear colour palettes
Optimisation of Polygon.contains()
Uses new background map server
Re-added datetime label on animations
Support for explicitly-specified axis bounds (i.e. "bounds" attribute in NetCDF)
Bugfixes:
    Animations respect log scale
    Metadata filters on ImageLayers now only get applied to the relevant layers (not all layers)
    Border around extraction area now only applies to glyph layers
    Handles environments where the user's home directory is non-writable
    Handles curvilinear cells which cross the dateline
    Changed title for EN3/4 extracted features
    Widened clickable box for GFI on continuous domain.  Rounding errors meant that the current one was a little too small
    Arrow plots now use BGCOLOR parameter
    Arrow plots have a default style
    Changed default vector legend graphic to not include arrows

1.0.4
=====
Modified AbstractPointDataset to make it simpler to extend
Preliminary support for WaterML
Made it possible to specify dataset as part of the URL
Access to specific datasets in Godiva3 (incl. dynamic datasets)
Better error handling in Godiva3
Support for named colours
Fixed bug where a parsing error on a style can cause ncWMS not to start
Preliminary support for MODIS land cover

1.0.3
=====
Added CHANGELOG
Use latest version of JFreeChart
Bugfixes:
    Geographic bounding boxes were not always working in GetCapabilities
    Time values were not read correctly in aggregations when they were stored as floats
    Title generation for dynamic datasets
    Return numerical data in same type as underlying storage

1.0.2
=====
Update docs
Bugfixes:
    Layer names were not appearing in capabilities document
    Last update times were not appearing in ncWMS admin interface
    Only show messages from exceptions if present

1.0.1
=====
Updated docs
Fixed bug where pcolor library was not being included in edal-graphics

1.0
===
First release of EDAL 1.0 / ncWMS 2.0
