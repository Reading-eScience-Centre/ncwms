ncWMS is a [Web Map Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) for geospatial data that are stored in CF-compliant NetCDF files. The intention is to create a WMS that requires minimal configuration: the source data files should already contain most of the necessary metadata. ncWMS is developed and maintained by the Reading e-Science Centre ([ReSC](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/resc/home/)) at the University of Reading, UK.

ncWMS v2 is built on top of the [EDAL]((https://reading-escience-centre.gitbooks.io/edal-user-guide/content/)) libraries developed by ReSC
